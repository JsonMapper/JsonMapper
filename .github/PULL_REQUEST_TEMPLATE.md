Replace this notice by a short README for your feature/bugfix.
This will help reviewers and should be a good start for the documentation.

Additionally:
 - Always add tests and ensure they pass.
 - Features and deprecations must be submitted against the latest develop branch.
 - For new features, provide some code snippets to help understand usage.
 - Never break backward compatibility
